I'm sure you've been directed here out of a curiosity for Linux. What is it? How can I use it?
Let's go ahead and answer those.

Linux is an operating system, similar to Windows or Mac OS.
You can use Linux for anything you'd like. On your personal computer, a server, phone, fridge -- you get the idea.
1. Great! So...how much is it, and how do I buy a license?
   * Ok, here's where things get interesting. Unlike Windows/Mac, the license given is one that is focused on you, the end user. The operating system is licensed under the [GNU General Public License version 2][GPL2]. This allows for source code to be freely obtained (not necessarily without charge) and changed. Something you're not able to get from the previous two systems mentioned. That's one of the reasons why Linux has survived and thrived so well in different areas. People keep contributing new things to it. This is also one of the reasons why we call Linux "free". It is free as in the "freedom to do as you choose" aspect.

   * It just so happens that many (but not all) distributions -- linux operating system variants produced by companies/groups/individuals  -- provide their software to users at no cost to them. That certainly makes it easy to get started.
2. What if I don't want to get rid of Windows/Mac OS? What if I just want to try it?  
	>There's a few different ways you can temporarily try Linux.
	    
	* Run Linux in a "Live" Environment. You can put Linux on a USB drive and boot it that way. It can be run temporarily off of it, or you can even choose for it to save its configuration/files over reboots. However, it's good to note that this could be slower due to the USB drive speed.
	      
	* Virtualize Linux and run it inside a virtual machine on your current PC (given you have enough disk space/memory.
	  
	* "Dual-booting" provides a means with which you can have two operating systems on a computer at a time. To switch, you just reboot and select the one you want to use. Note that this method is less temporary, as you could end up reducing your current operating system's disk space to accomodate an installation of linux. You could also choose to install linux on a new disk and boot from it to avoid this type of issue.
	  
	* If you want to go full speed ahead, you can always fully install Linux and in the process delete everything on your current disk. Before doing so, backup all your important documents/files!!!
